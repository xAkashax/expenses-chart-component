# Frontend Mentor - Expenses chart component solution

This is a solution to the [Expenses chart component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/expenses-chart-component-e7yJBUdjwt). 

This challenge took me a lot of time. I made it a little different. 
This project is not perfect. I didn't focus on the exact css copping. I did it interactive using the data from data.json.
This way, if something changes in the data, it gets changed and mapped to the chart.
I calculated the current amount for this month as a function and displayed it in the project.
You can see hover states for interactive elements on the page,  see the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars.
When you click on a bar, it will be highlighted and its label with the amount will be displayed.
